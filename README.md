## About

WEBZONE is a blogging application for web development. It is a place where users can read blog posts about web development. Users can also create their own free accounts and create as many posts as they wish about web development.

I created this application to serve the purpose of my Data-Centric Development Milestone Project at Code Institute. The project scope was to create a web app using Python and a no-SQL database (MongoDB), which uses CRUD operations to allow users to easily create, read, update, and delete blog posts.The front-end display and functionality uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The back-end functionality uses Python, Flask, and MongoDB.

## UX

### User Stories

* As a user, I want a blogging site where I can read posts about web development.

* As a user, I want to be able to create my own posts about web development so that I can inspire others. 

* As a user, I want to be able to edit and update any post I create in case of any mistake or new additional information.

* As a user, I want to be able to search for posts about a particular topic in web development using keywords.

* As a user, I want to be able to delete any post created by me if I choose to do so.

### Research

To understand how to create a blogging app, I  researched tutorials with Python and MongoDB on Youtube and Udemy, and I could get a clear idea of what functionality and design I wanted my web application to have.  User Authentication is not a requirement for Code Institute's Data-Centric Mile Stone Project project but however, I implemented basic user authentication and it was copied from Code Institute's task manager mini-project.

### Style Rationale

I wanted to keep it simple while practicing responsive design.

## Technologies Used

### languages used

* [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) 

The use of HTML which stands for Hypertext Markup Language was very paramount to this website as with every website or web-based app. HTML5 was used in this project to keep up with the latest industry standards. 

* [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)

The use of CSS which stands for Cascading Style Sheet was also very paramount to this project. CSS was used for styling the content on the website.

* [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

Javascript, which is mostly been referred to as JS was used in this project mainly through Materialize

* [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))

Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

### Libraries And Frameworks

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It was used in this project to simplify the DOM.

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

Google Fonts is a library of 991 free licensed font families, an interactive web directory for browsing the library, and APIs for conveniently using the fonts via CSS and Android. Fugaz One designed by Latino Type and Roboto designed by Christian Robertson, were both used in this project.  

### Tools used

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.Git was used in this project for version control.

* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)

Gitpod is an online integrated development environment for GitHub. It creates a complete and disposable development environment for any GitHub repository directly in a browser. This project was developed in Gitpod.

* [GitHub]()

GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control. GitHub is the platform where the code for this project has been hosted.

* [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) supporting several programming languages. One of the first cloud platforms, Heroku has been in development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language, but now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go. Heroku is the platform where this project has been deployed.

* [Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)

Chrome DevTools is a set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser. DevTools can help you edit pages on-the-fly and diagnose problems quickly, which ultimately helps you build better websites, faster. Google Chrome's Dev Tools was used in the building process of this project.

* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)

Balsamiq Wireframes is a rapid low-fidelity UI wireframing tool that reproduces the experience of sketching on a notepad or whiteboard, but using a computer. Balsamiq wireframes was used in producing the wireframes for this project.
